## Introduction

Welcome to my first project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (optional) only.

The Wizard's Tower is a project for a fictional magic-themed cocktail bar inspired by potion brewing classes in the Harry Potter movie.

Users will be able to navigate through the website using a functional navigation bar. Wizard's Tower will offer for the user to see what the purpose of the business is on the home page.
The user will also be able to see a menu of cocktails being served as well as contact the business via the contact form on the dedicated page.

## UX - User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book The Elements of User Experience.
In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage.
This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane

### Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want webpage to be a user-friendly and responsive.
- As a creator, I want users to be able to see what the business has to offer immidiately (on a home page).
- As a creator, I want users to be motivated to book activities being offered by business and/or book a table after visiting a webpage.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to navigate across the site to see different pages on a webpage.
- As a user, I want the purpose of a webpage to be clear so I can decide if the content is right for me.
- As a user, I want to see the available activities and drinks menu.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact the business either via phone or online.

**User stories are based on online research, personal experience, and my relatives experiences.**

## The Scope Plane

I thought of the features I wanted to implement before designing the project, and a few of them were not achievable within my deadline. I decided to implement the ones covering my user stories first and add the remaining features later.

**Features implemented upon webpage release**

- Home Page with an introduction and business opening times.
- Functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.
- Menu page allowing users to see a menu of drinks being served.
- Contact page allowing users to fill out a form and contact a business to either provide a feedback, ask questions or/and request a table or activity reservation.
- A button to take the user back to the home page after filling out contact a form.
- Footer with an address, contact details, and links to social media.
  
**Features planned to add later**

- A feature for booking a table to separate it from a contact form, which will be added to a home page.
- A feature that will send a user an e-mail confirmation after making a reservation or filling out a contact form.
- An additional section showing customer reviews from Google. This will also be added to the home page.
- An additional page for a photo gallery containing photos from activities like potions brewing.

### Fonts

Both fonts used in this project are Google Fonts.

#### Roboto :

- I used Roboto as the main font, as it's one of the most popular and user-friendly fonts. The Roboto font is easy to read even on the smallest devices and provides a positive user experience.

#### Exo :

- Exo font has been used for some headings but also for a navigation bar and menu section. Using a different font for these features helped me highlight important sections to user and made the website easier and quicker to navigate.

## The Skeleton Plane

I made some significant changes to my project. Some features have become unnecessary or have caused poor user experience, so I decided to remove them.

[Home page wireframes](https://github.com/PatrycjaBlaszkowska/project-WizardsTower/blob/main/docs/wireframes/home.pdf)

- I used a different hero photo for mobile devices with a width of the screen under 992 pixels, as the original photo was too big and looks unattractive when scaled.
- I also made most content appear in two columns on the desktop instead of one for a better user experience.
- The navigation bar has been moved to the left side on the mobile devices to provide some space between it and a logo. I made this decision to keep the navbar tidy and more user-friendly.

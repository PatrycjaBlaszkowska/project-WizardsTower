# Testing - User stories

### As a user, I want to be able to navigate across the site to see different pages on a webpage.

Every page across the site have a navigation bar fixed to the top of the page. Navbar toggles to a hamburger menu on mobile devices but stays fully responsive. 

Desktop:

### As a user, I want the purpose of a webpage to be clear so I can decide if the content is right for me.

A home page includes two important sections explaining the purpose of the website to the user.
User can see that Wizards Tower is a cocktail bar serving "potions" but also available activities.

Potions/cocktails:

# Testing - User stories

### As a user, I want to be able to navigate across the site to see different pages on a webpage.

Every page across the site has a navigation bar fixed to the top of the page. Navbar toggles to a hamburger menu on mobile devices but stays fully responsive. 

Desktop:

Mobile:

User can also navigate through the webpage from the bottom of each site by using footer links.

### As a user, I want the purpose of a webpage to be clear so I can decide if the content is right for me.

A home page includes two important sections explaining the purpose of the website to the user.
The user can see that Wizards Tower is a cocktail bar serving potions, which are alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails.

Potions/cocktails:

### As a user, I want to see the available activities and drinks menu.

The home page is also showing all available activities, so the user can easily find them.

Activities:

The second page is designated for a menu. The user can see the available cocktails to choose from.
